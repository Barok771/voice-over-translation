        Voice-over-translation does not guarantee to work with every video or at all. If Voice-over-translation can't translate some media, this is most likely not a software bug, and you should not report it here.
        Please only report software bugs, such as:
          * menu issues
          * feature issus
          * other problems (not feature request)

        Make sure you are running the latest version of voice-over-translation.
        The bug you are experiencing may already have been fixed.

        Please try to include as much information as possible.
